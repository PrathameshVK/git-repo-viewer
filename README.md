- User page has some basic information of the user, like profile image, name, bio, location, and github profile link of that user. Clicking on link in the user info will take you directly to the user profile on github.
- Each repo card has information as follows -
  - Repo name
  - Last updated time of the repo
  - Number of stars, if have any
  - Description of the repo
  - Tags for topics of the repo
- Clicking on the repo name in the card will take you directly to the github link of that repo
- This page also has a search repo feature, which can be used to search among the available repos. We can search for repo name, description or topic name. Entered search string will be searched among all three and matching repos will be returned.
- Basic paginator is there to help you navigate among the repos. We can set limit of repos to be displayed at a time.<br><br>
